# Bubble Game 

This is a small browser game I made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
The idea is simple â€“ you get a random target number at the top, and you have to click on the bubbles with the same number to score points. Thereâ€™s also a timer running, so the goal is to get as many points as possible before time runs out.

## Features
- Random bubbles with numbers (0â€“9)
- Timer countdown (default 60s)
- Score counter
- Clean and minimal UI

---

## How to play
1. Look at the **Hit number** on the top bar.
2. Click on bubbles that match the number.
3. Each correct click adds **+10** to your score.
4. Keep playing until the timer reaches 0.
